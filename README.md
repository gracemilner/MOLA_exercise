# MOLA_exercise
Exercise using Multi-Objective Land Allocation (MOLA) to assign pixels certain land use types based on demand and suitability assessments.

## About
This script was developed as part of an exercise testing out the MOLA procedure as a method for assigning land use types. 
The process takes into account pre-determined demand requirements for three different land use types (arable, pasture, forest), calculates and ranks suitability of individual pixels for each land use based on a range of factors, and deals with conflicts to determine the optimal assignments. 

The exercise is based around the context of examining changes in land use patterns through time, particularly from the Hellenistic period to the Late Roman period in an area of present-day Turkey.

## Outputs
The output is a final land use map for the chosen time period, showing the distribution of arable, pasture, and forest.
